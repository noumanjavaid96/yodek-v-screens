            parts=[
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process to structure the documentation based on the provided images:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a structured document defining the \"flow\" of the platform shown in the images. This means organizing the images logically and describing the user journey or the different sections of the platform they represent.

2.  **Identify the Platform:** Look for branding or logos. The logo \"yodeck\" appears consistently in the top left corner of the UI images. This identifies the platform as Yodeck, likely a digital signage management system.

3.  **Initial Image Scan & Categorization:** Quickly glance through all the images. What are the main types of screens or actions shown?
    *   Grey images (ignore, likely placeholders or errors).
    *   QR code for WiFi.
    *   Onboarding/Welcome screens (asking about industry, organization size, screen usage, number of screens).
    *   Dashboard/Welcome screen (main landing page after login/onboarding).
    *   Media section (Images).
    *   Apps section (WiFi Share, Date & Time).
    *   Playlists section (creating/editing playlists, adding items).
    *   Layouts section (editing a layout, floor plan example).
    *   Schedules section (creating events).
    *   Screens section (adding screens, viewing screen status).
    *   A sample advertisement/content screen (Summer Sale).

4.  **Determine the Starting Point:** Where does a user typically begin?
    *   The onboarding sequence (questions about industry, size, usage) seems like the very first interaction for a new user.
    *   After onboarding, the \"Welcome\" or \"Dashboard\" screen is the logical next step.

5.  **Sequence the Onboarding:** Arrange the onboarding images in order (they are numbered 2 of 5, 3 of 5, 4 of 5, 5 of 5). The \"You are all set!\" screen comes last in this sequence.
    *   Image 2/5: Industry
    *   Image 3/5: Organization Size
    *   Image 4/5: Number of Screens
    *   Image 5/5: Screen Usage Purpose
    *   Final Onboarding: \"You are all set!\"

6.  **Identify Core Sections:** Based on the left-hand navigation menu visible in many screenshots (Welcome, Dashboard, Media, Apps, Playlists, Layouts, Schedules, Screens), organize the remaining images by these sections.

7.  **Structure the Flow:** Create a logical progression through the platform's main functions. A typical workflow might be:
    *   Onboarding (for new users).
    *   Welcome/Dashboard (overview).
    *   Managing Content (Media, Apps).
    *   Organizing Content (Playlists, Layouts).
    *   Scheduling Content (Schedules).
    *   Managing Displays (Screens).
    *   Example Content (Summer Sale, WiFi QR).

8.  **Flesh out Each Section:** Describe what's happening in the images for each section.

    *   **Onboarding:** Describe the purpose of each step (gathering user context).
    *   **Welcome/Dashboard:** Show the main landing page, highlighting key areas like adding a screen, creating playlists, templates, and potentially the dashboard view with screen status/map (if applicable after adding screens).
    *   **Media Management:** Show the \"Images\" subsection. Explain how to view, add, and manage media files (using the actions menu: Edit, Add to Playlist, etc.).
    *   **App Management:** Show the \"Apps\" section. Explain how apps (like WiFi Share, Date & Time) are listed and managed. Mention creating new apps.
    *   **Playlist Management:** Show the playlist creation/editing screen. Explain how to name playlists, set transitions, add media/apps, set durations, and save. Show the list view of playlists.
    *   **Layout Management:** Show the layout editor. Explain that layouts define screen regions. Use the floor plan image as an example of a complex layout. Mention availability settings.
    *   **Schedule Management:** Show the scheduling interface. Explain how to create events, assign content (playlists/layouts), set start/end times/dates, and define recurrence.
    *   **Screen Management:** Show the screen overview page (even if it shows \"You don't have any Screens\"). Explain the process of adding screens (pairing physical devices) and viewing their status. Mention player purchase/connection options.
    *   **Example Content/Use Cases:** Include the specific examples shown:
        *   WiFi Share App (QR Code generation).
        *   Summer Sale Ad (example of displayed content).
        *   Floor Plan Layout (example of wayfinding).

9.  **Refine and Format:**
    *   Use clear headings and subheadings based on the identified sections.
    *   Use bullet points for clarity when describing actions or features within a screen.
    *   Add an introduction explaining the purpose of the document and the platform.
    *   Add a conclusion summarizing the flow.
    *   Ensure consistent terminology (e.g., \"Media,\" \"Playlists,\" \"Screens\").
    *   Reference the specific images where appropriate (although the user didn't explicitly ask for image mapping, describing the *content* of the images implicitly links them).
    *   Review for logical flow and completeness based *only* on the provided images. Avoid making assumptions about features not shown. *Self-correction: Initially, I might have just listed the sections, but \"flow\" implies a sequence, so ordering them logically (onboarding -> dashboard -> content -> organization -> scheduling -> deployment) is better.*

10. **Final Check:** Read through the generated document. Does it accurately reflect the images? Is it structured logically? Does it define the flow of using the Yodeck platform as depicted? Is it easy to understand?"""),

**Yodeck Platform User Flow Documentation**

**1. Introduction & Onboarding (New User Experience)**

*   **Purpose:** To set up the account and tailor the platform experience based on the user's context.
*   **Flow:**
    *   **(Image: Welcome - Step 2 of 5 - Industry)** The user is prompted to select the industry they operate in (e.g., Retail/Shopping, Education, Healthcare). This helps Yodeck suggest relevant templates and features.
    *   **(Image: Welcome - Step 3 of 5 - Organization Size)** The user specifies the size of their organization (e.g., 1-10 people, 51-200 people).
    *   **(Image: Welcome - Step 4 of 5 - Number of Screens)** The user indicates the total number of screens they plan to set up (e.g., 1 screen only, 6-20 screens). This helps gauge deployment size for support and planning.
    *   **(Image: Welcome - Step 5 of 5 - Screen Usage)** The user selects how they plan to use their screens (e.g., Product Display/Promotions, Entrance/Outdoor Offers, In-Store Navigation, Other). This helps understand the primary use cases.
    *   **(Image: Welcome - You are all set!)** Completion of the initial setup prompts the user, potentially offering a newsletter sign-up before proceeding.
    *   **(Image: Welcome - Main)** After onboarding (or for returning users), the user lands on a welcome screen. This area likely provides starting points like \"Add a Screen,\" \"Create Your First Playlist,\" or \"Check Out All Templates.\"

**2. Dashboard Overview**

*   **Purpose:** To provide a high-level view of the digital signage network.
*   **Flow:**
    *   **(Image: Dashboard)** The main dashboard typically shows:
        *   A greeting message.
        *   Prompts to get started (e.g., \"I need a player,\" \"I have a player\").
        *   Screen Status (initially showing no screens added).
        *   A map visualizing screen locations (once screens are added).
        *   Subscription plan details.
        *   Quick access to purchasing or adding players/screens.

**3. Media Management**

    *   Options include `Create App`.
    *   **(Image: Sample Wifi Scan App Preview)** This specific app generates a QR code allowing viewers to easily connect to a designated WiFi network. This demonstrates one type of app functionality.

**5. Playlist Management**

*   **Purpose:** To sequence media and apps for playback on screens.
*   **Flow:**
    *   Navigate to `Playlists`.
    *   **(Image: Playlist Details - List View)** View existing playlists (e.g., \"Showcase Playlist,\" \"Entrance Offer,\" \"Sample Wifi Scan\"). Shows items within the selected playlist and their duration.
    *   **(Image: Playlist Details - Edit View 1 & 2)** Create a new playlist or edit an existing one:
        *   Define `Name` and `Description`.
        *   Configure `Transition Options` (e.g., enable/disable transitions, set type like 'Fade', set speed/duration).
        *   Configure `Playback Options` (e.g., Sync Playback, Random Playback).
        *   `Upload Media` directly or add existing Media/Apps from the library to the playlist sequence.
        *   Set the duration each item should display.
        *   `Save` the playlist.

**6. Layout Management**

*   **Purpose:** To design screen templates, dividing the display area into zones for different content types.
*   **Flow:**
    *   Navigate to `Layouts`.
    *   **(Image: Layout Editor - Floor Plan)** Create or edit a layout:
        *   The main area shows a visual representation of the screen layout (e.g., a background image with defined zones for a logo, main content, ticker, QR code). The example shows a complex store floor plan/directory.
        *   Tools are available to insert elements (text, images, media zones, apps).
        *   **(Image: Layout Editor - Advanced Tab)** Configure advanced settings like `Availability` (scheduling when the layout is active) and locking options.
        *   `Save` the layout.

**7. Schedule Management**

*   **Purpose:** To define when specific content (Playlists, Layouts, Media, Apps) should play on screens.
*   **Flow:**
    *   Navigate to `Schedules`.
    *   **(Image: New Event Popup)** Create a `New Event`:
        *   Select `Event Type` (e.g., Schedule Content, Turn screen Off).
        *   Assign `Content` (select the Playlist, Layout, Media, or App to be scheduled).
        *   Set `Event Starts` and `Event Ends` date and time.
        *   Define `Repeat Options` (e.g., Does not repeat, Daily, Weekly).
        *   View the schedule on a calendar interface (showing existing events).
        *   `Save` the event.

**8. Screen Management**

*   **Purpose:** To add, monitor, and manage the physical display screens connected to the Yodeck account.
*   **Flow:**
    *   Navigate to `Screens`.
    *   **(Image: Screens - No Screens Added)** If no screens are registered, prompts are shown:
        *   `Add Screen`: To register a new Yodeck player or compatible device using its registration code.
        *   Options to `Get free Players` (often tied to annual plans), `Purchase a Player`, or `Connect your own Players` (using various methods/devices).
    *   (Once screens are added, this section would typically display a list of screens, their status (online/offline), assigned content, location, and management options).

**9. Content Display Examples**

*   **(Image: Summer Sale Ad)** Shows an example of final content displayed on a screen – in this case, a promotional graphic for a summer sale, incorporating text, imagery, and a QR code.
*   **(Image: Sample Wifi Scan App Preview)** Shows the specific output of the WiFi Share app – a QR code ready for display.

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process to generate the structured Yodeck platform flow document based on the 22 images:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a structured document describing the flow of the Yodeck digital signage platform, using all 22 provided images as context. This means identifying the different sections of the platform, the actions users can take, and how the screens/images relate to a typical workflow.

2.  **Initial Scan and Categorization:** Quickly look through all 22 images. Group them mentally or physically (if printed) based on the main section of the UI they represent.
    *   **Onboarding/Welcome:** Several screens with \"Welcome,\" \"Step X of 5,\" \"You are all set!\"
    *   **Dashboard:** The main overview screen with map, screen status, etc.
    *   **Media Management:** Screens showing \"All Media,\" \"Images,\" \"Documents\" upload, actions like \"Add Image,\" \"Delete.\"
    *   **Apps Management:** Screens showing \"Apps,\" listing specific apps like \"Wifi Scan,\" the QR code preview.
    *   **Playlist Management:** Screens showing \"Playlists,\" \"Playlist Details\" (both list and edit views), options like transitions, adding media.
    *   **Layout Management:** Screens showing the \"Layout\" editor, including the floor plan example, advanced settings, layout properties.
    *   **Schedule Management:** Screens showing the \"Schedules\" calendar view and the \"New Event\" popup.
    *   **Screen Management:** The screen showing \"You don't have any Screens,\" with options to add/buy players.
    *   **Content Examples:** The final \"Summer Sale\" ad, the \"Wifi Scan\" QR code.

3.  **Determine the Logical Flow:** How would a *new user* typically interact with this platform?
    *   First, they sign up/log in and go through onboarding.
    *   Then, they land on a Welcome screen or Dashboard.
    *   To show something, they need content: Upload Media (Images, Videos, Docs) and/or create Apps.
    *   They need to organize this content: Create Playlists.
    *   They might want specific screen designs: Create Layouts.
    *   They need to control *when* content plays: Create Schedules.
    *   They need physical displays: Add Screens/Players.
    *   Finally, they push the content/schedules to the screens.

4.  **Draft the Structure:** Create headings based on the logical flow and the categories identified in step 2.

    *   1. Introduction & Onboarding
    *   2. Dashboard Overview
    *   3. Media Management
    *   4. App Management
    *   5. Playlist Management
    *   6. Layout Management
    *   7. Schedule Management
    *   8. Screen Management
    *   9. Content Display Examples (Optional, but good for context)

5.  **Flesh out each section:** Go through the grouped images for each section and describe the purpose and steps shown. Refer *specifically* to the image content.

    *   **Onboarding:** Describe the industry, org size, screen count, and usage questions. Mention the final \"all set\" screen and the main welcome screen. *(Images: Welcome - Steps 2, 3, 4, 5 of 5; You are all set; Welcome - Main)*
    *   **Dashboard:** Describe the components visible: greeting, start prompts, screen status, map, subscription info. *(Image: Dashboard)*
    *   **Media:** Explain navigating to different media types (All Media, Images, Documents). Show the upload process (drag/drop, types like PDF, Word, PPT). Show the list view and the actions available (Edit, Add to Playlist, Delete, etc.). *(Images: All Media list; Images list; Image Actions; Document Upload Popup)*
    *   **Apps:** Explain navigating to Apps. Show the list view (Sample Wifi Scan, Retail Store Time). Mention the \"Create App\" button. Show the specific WiFi QR code example. *(Images: Apps List; Sample Wifi Scan App Preview)*
    *   **Playlists:** Explain navigating to Playlists. Show the list/details view where you add items. Show the edit view where you set Name, Description, Transitions, Playback Options, and add content with durations. *(Images: Playlist Details - List View; Playlist Details - Edit View 1; Playlist Details - Edit View 2)*
    *   **Layouts:** Explain navigating to Layouts. Show the visual editor with the complex floor plan example. Mention inserting elements. Show the Layout properties panel (Name, Ratio, Background). Show the Advanced tab for scheduling/locking. *(Images: Layout Editor - Floor Plan; Layout Editor - Properties Tab; Layout Editor - Advanced Tab)*
    *   **Schedules:** Explain navigating to Schedules. Show the calendar view. Describe creating a New Event: type, content selection, start/end times, repeat options. *(Images: Schedules Calendar; New Event Popup)*
    *   **Screens:** Explain navigating to Screens. Show the initial state (\"You don't have any Screens\"). Describe the options presented: Add Screen (for existing players), Get Free Players, Purchase Player, Connect Own Players. *(Image: Screens - No Screens Added)*
    *   **Content Examples:** Add a concluding note showing what the final output might look like, referencing the Summer Sale ad and the Wifi QR code again as examples of content generated/managed within the platform. *(Images: Summer Sale Ad; Sample Wifi Scan App Preview - reused for context)*

6.  **Refine and Review:**
    *   Read through the entire document. Does it flow logically?
    *   Is the language clear and concise? (Rephrase copied text).
    *   Have all 22 images been referenced or clearly contribute to the described flow? (Double-check against the image list).
    *   Is the purpose of each section clear?
    *   Add introductory and concluding remarks if needed.
    *   Ensure consistent formatting (bolding, lists).

7.  **Self-Correction Example During Review:** Initially, I might have just listed features. Realized the request was for a *flow*, so reordered the sections to follow a more natural user progression (Onboarding -> Dashboard -> Content Creation -> Organization -> Scheduling -> Deployment). Also, made sure to explicitly link *which* images illustrate *which* part of the flow. Ensured all 22 distinct images were accounted for in the description. For instance, confirmed both the \"Layout Editor - Properties Tab\" and \"Layout Editor - Advanced Tab\" images were used to describe Layout Management fully. Confirmed the \"All Media\" list view was included alongside the specific \"Images\" list view."""),

        ),
        types.Content(
            role="user",
            parts=[
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Can you please give me the links to the iamges in order please?"""),

            parts=[
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's my thought process for fulfilling the request to list the image links in order:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants the *links* to the images they previously provided, and they want them listed in the *order* they appeared in the previous prompt (or at least, the order I processed them in the detailed workflow).

2.  **Identify the Constraint:** I am a large language model. I *processed* the images the user uploaded, but I don't retain the original source URLs or file paths from the user's upload session. The images were temporarily available for me to analyze during the previous turn, but they aren't stored persistently in a way I can directly link back to *after* the analysis is complete. My \"memory\" of the images is the analysis and description I generated, not the raw image files or their original locations.

3.  **Formulate the Response:**
    *   **Acknowledge the Request:** Start by directly addressing the user's request for the image links in order.
    *   **Explain the Limitation:** Clearly state *why* I cannot provide the links. Explain that as an AI, I processed the images but don't store or have access to their original URLs or file locations after the interaction.
    *   **Offer Alternatives/Clarification:** Since I can't provide the *links*, offer the next best thing based on the previous interaction. I *did* process them in a specific order to create the structured document. I can list the *descriptions* or *key identifiers* of the images in the order I used them. This confirms I understood the sequence and provides a reference point for the user based on the content of the images themselves.
    *   **Structure the Alternative:** List the images based on the descriptions used in the previous detailed workflow document. Numbering them makes the sequence clear. Use concise identifiers derived from the image content or the section they represented in the workflow.

4.  **Refine the Alternative List (Self-Correction/Improvement):**
    *   Initial thought: Just list \"Image 1\", \"Image 2\", etc. *Problem:* This isn't very helpful to the user without the actual images.
    *   Better approach: Use the descriptive titles/contexts from the workflow document. This connects the list back to the previous answer and helps the user identify which image corresponds to which step. Examples: \"Sample Wifi Scan App Preview,\" \"Apps List,\" \"Images List,\" \"Playlist Details - List View,\" etc.
    *   Ensure the order matches the flow described previously. Double-check the sequence used in the 22-image workflow description.

5.  **Final Output Construction (incorporating the above):**

    *   Start with the direct apology/explanation: \"Unfortunately, I cannot provide direct links to the images you uploaded.\"
    *   Explain *why*: \"As an AI, I processed the images you provided during our previous interaction to understand their content and create the workflow document. However, I don't store these images or have access to their original file locations or URLs after the processing is complete.\"
    *   Offer the alternative: \"However, I can list the images in the order I analyzed them for the structured document, using the descriptions from that document to help you identify them:\"
    *   Create the numbered list using the descriptive identifiers:
        1.  Welcome - Step 2 of 5 - Industry
        2.  Welcome - Step 3 of 5 - Organization Size
        3.  Welcome - Step 4 of 5 - Number of Screens
        4.  Welcome - Step 5 of 5 - Screen Usage
        5.  Welcome - You are all set!

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to know which original image number corresponds to each description I used in the structured workflow document. They previously provided 22 images, and I need to link my descriptions back to those specific images.

2.  **Recall the Constraint:** I know I cannot *display* the images again or provide direct links. My access was temporary for analysis.

3.  **Identify the Key Information:** The user provided a set of images (implicitly numbered 1 through 22 based on the order they were likely presented or processed). I generated descriptions for each relevant image and used them in a structured workflow.

4.  **Strategy: Re-analyze the Provided Images (Internal Simulation):** Although I can't *show* the images, my internal processing retains a representation or understanding of the content of each image from the initial analysis. I need to mentally (or through internal data mapping if available) go through the images provided in the *second* request (which seems to be a subset or re-ordered set of the original 22) and match them to the descriptions I created for the *first* request (which used all 22).

5.  **Execution - Step-by-Step Matching (Based on the second set of images provided):**

    *   **Image 1 (in the second request): `Sample Wifi Scan App Preview`** - This matches description #13 from my full list.
    *   **Image 2 (in the second request): `Apps List`** - This matches description #12.
    *   **Image 3 (in the second request): `Images List`** - This matches description #9.
    *   **Image 4 (in the second request): `Playlist Details - List View`** - This matches description #14.
    *   **Image 5 (in the second request): `Playlist Details - Edit View 1`** - This matches description #15.
    *   **Image 6 (in the second request): `Document Upload Popup`** - This matches description #11.
    *   **Image 7 (in the second request): `Image Actions`** - This matches description #10.
    *   **Image 8 (in the second request): `Schedules Calendar`** - This matches description #19.
    *   **Image 9 (in the second request): `All Media list`** - This matches description #8.
    *   **Image 10 (in the second request): `Welcome - Step 4 of 5 - Number of Screens`** - This matches description #3.
    *   **Image 11 (in the second request): `Welcome - Step 3 of 5 - Organization Size`** - This matches description #2.
    *   **Image 12 (in the second request): `New Event Popup`** - This matches description #20.
    *   **Image 13 (in the second request): `Screens - No Screens Added`** - This matches description #21.
    *   **Image 14 (in the second request): `Playlist Details - Edit View 2`** - This matches description #16.
    *   **Image 15 (in the second request): `Welcome - Step 2 of 5 - Industry`** - This matches description #1.

    *   **Image 20 (in the second request): `Layout Editor - Layout Tab`** - This matches description #18.
    *   **Image 21 (in the second request): `Dashboard`** - This matches description #7.
    *   **Image 22 (in the second request): `Summer Sale Ad`** - This matches description #22.

6.  **Format the Output:** Present the information clearly, listing each image number (from the second request's sequence) alongside the corresponding description I generated earlier. Add a clarifying note about the numbering referring to the sequence in the *second* prompt where the images were displayed again.

7.  **Final Review:** Read through the generated list and compare it against the images (mentally) and the descriptions to ensure accuracy. Confirm that all 22 images from the second prompt are accounted for and correctly mapped."""),
